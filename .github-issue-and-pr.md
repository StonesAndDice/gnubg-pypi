**Title:** `gnubg.wd` not included in built wheel package

**Body:**

## Problem

The neural-net weights file `gnubg.wd` is built (or copied from prebuilt) by a Meson `custom_target` and installed with `install_tag: 'python-runtime'`. When building the wheel, meson-python runs `meson install`; if only the default install tags are used (e.g. `runtime`), files tagged `python-runtime` are not installed, so `gnubg.wd` is missing from the wheel.

## Expected behavior

The built wheel should contain `gnubg/data/gnubg.wd` so the package works without requiring users to build or supply the file separately.

## Solution

Add `[tool.meson-python.args]` with `install = ["--tags=runtime,python-runtime"]` so that `meson install` includes `python-runtime`-tagged outputs (including the custom_target that installs `gnubg.wd`) into the wheel layout.

**Title:** fix: include gnubg.wd in wheel via meson install --tags=python-runtime

**Body:**

## Summary

Ensures the generated/copied `gnubg.wd` file is installed into the wheel by including the `python-runtime` install tag when meson-python runs `meson install`.

## Problem

`gnubg.wd` is produced by a `custom_target` in `meson.build` with `install_tag: 'python-runtime'`. Without requesting that tag during install, the file is not installed into the wheel staging area and is missing from the package.

## Change

- **pyproject.toml**: Add `[tool.meson-python.args]` with `install = ["--tags=runtime,python-runtime"]` so both default runtime files and `python-runtime`-tagged outputs (including the gnubg.wd custom_target) are included in the wheel.
